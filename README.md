Predictive modeling is often used by for-profit organizations, but this report shows how even non-profit organizations benefit from using the same. Many non-profits have untapped potential and sleeping dogs in their database. The cost of contacting everyone on the database is sometimes remarkably high. Non-profits can use predictive modeling to identify persuadable, sure things, lost causes, and sleeping dogs to reduce contact cost and maximize donations.

The aim of using predictive modelling here is to help Non-profit organization to identify prospective donors based on historical data collected and stored by organization throughout the years. By using modelling techniques, organization will be able to forecast future donors and donation amounts.
